# Unit 9 Workshop

This repository is for learners on Corndel's DevOps apprenticeship.

## Pre-requisites

You need to have an Azure account. Contact a tutor if you do not have access to one.

Also, make sure you have installed the following:
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
  * Verify it is installed by running `az --version` 
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
  * There is no installer, extract the zip and put terraform.exe in a folder that is on your PATH
  * Verify it is installed by running `terraform -version`
* Install an extension for Terraform in VSCode
  * There are a few options, any will do, we just want syntax highlighting
